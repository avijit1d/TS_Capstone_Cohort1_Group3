# Customer Review Insights & Response Generator
Organizations struggle to process high volume of unstructured customer feedback from review
platforms. Manual analysis is slow, inconsistent, and can't keep up, making it hard to generate
personalized responses. This project is an endeavour to develop an automated, end-to-end
Customer Review Insights & Response Generation System.

It uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and N8N workflow automation to ingest, preprocess,
translate, and analyze reviews (sentiment, topics) from multiple sources. The system will
generate personalized responses, store in a structured format, and support trend discovery and
visualization via Tableau dashboards. The goal is a scalable, LLM-driven automation framework
to streamline customer experience management, reduce manual workload, and improve insight
quality
